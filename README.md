# ⚖️ PA_PVP

**🧩 A PLUTONIUM-like Adversarial Peer Validation Protocol**

PA_PVP is a copy/paste decision loop.

You give it a plan, artifact, target, or uncertain situation. It gives back a verdict, a next action, and a state you can paste back later.

It can stay light for small reversible choices and expand for higher-impact decisions without changing the workflow.

🧠 Doubt is not a blocker.  
🔁 It is a state transition.

## 🚀 Start here

Use PA_PVP when something keeps staying vague:

- 🪶 a reversible choice that still needs a clean next step
- ⚖️ a decision that will not close
- 🧪 a plan that needs pressure-testing
- 🧱 an artifact that needs validation
- 🧭 a project with too many possible next steps
- 🔁 a previous PA_PVP output you want to continue

PA_PVP does not default to discussion. It forces the work into an operational shape:

- ⚡ `DO NOW`
- 🕓 `DO LATER`
- 🗑️ `DISCARD`
- ▶️ one `[NEXT]` action
- 📦 a snapshot you can paste back into the next run

---

## ⚡ Try it now

1. 📄 Load the canonical kernel:

   [`PA_PVP_full_v9.9.0_canonical.txt`](PA_PVP_full_v9.9.0_canonical.txt)

2. Ask in normal language.

Examples:

> Use PA_PVP on these findings and give me the next action.

> I have two viable options and no clear winner. Use PA_PVP to get a verdict.

> I'm stuck between a safe option and a risky one. Help me decide what moves next.

> This plan feels plausible but fragile. Use PA_PVP to test it.

> Give me PA_PVP output for this. (for starting the adversarial AI to AI loop.)

You can start messy.

Ask for PA_PVP output when you want a structured state you can paste back later.

That is enough for a first run.

## 🧾 What comes back

A valid PA_PVP decision run gives you two surfaces. 🔍

First: 🧠 one machine snapshot in a single code block.

Inside it, look for:

```text
[QUEUE]
```

and:

```text
[NEXT]
```

Typical first shape:

```text
STATE: DECISION.TEST.FINAL

[QUEUE]
E1 | DRAFT->ACTIVE | DO NOW | ... | gate:NONE | S1

[NEXT]
S1: <one executable or planned next action>
```

Second: 📋 a human table after the code block.

👀 The table is for scanning.  
📦 The code block is the state.

---

## 🔁 Run the loop

PA_PVP is meant to be run more than once.

Basic loop:

1. 📥 Paste a plan, artifact, target, or current PA_PVP state.
2. ⚖️ Get the verdict and `[NEXT]`.
3. 🧪 Execute, simulate, or inspect the next step.
4. 🔁 Paste the previous output back.
5. 🧭 PA_PVP continues from the state instead of restarting from zero.

You do not need to manually cut the previous output into pieces for normal continuation. A full previous PA_PVP snapshot can be pasted back as input.

## 🧯 Practical limits

PA_PVP is not a free-form brainstorming prompt. 🚫

Scalable does not mean heavy by default. Small runs should stay short; larger or riskier runs can expand only when the state justifies it.

It works best when there is something to push through a decision loop: a plan, artifact, trade-off, blocker, or previous state.

If evidence is weak, PA_PVP should not pretend certainty. Depending on the state, it may simulate a closure, park the item, request one minimal evidence input, probe the decision, or discard the item.

If the output is marked invalid, do not reuse it as machine state.

<summary>🧩 Technical reference</summary>

## 📌 Authority surface

The canonical kernel is:

[`PA_PVP_full_v9.9.0_canonical.txt`](PA_PVP_full_v9.9.0_canonical.txt)

The README is an entrypoint and technical reference. The kernel is the source of truth for execution semantics.

## 🧱 Kernel input

Optional batch header:

```text
<<<B keep_open=NO expire_days=30 exec_capability=NO_RUNTIME close_policy=SIM_OK ssot_scale=MIN resource_pool=>>>
```

Wrapped item:

```text
<<<I id=E1 title="short title" keep_open=NO expire_days=30 depends_on= uses= reversibility=>>>
...payload...
<<<END>>>
```

Each item uses exactly one mode:

```text
<<<PLAN>>>
- bullet list of actions/options OR numbered steps
```

```text
<<<ARTIFACT>>>
<prompt/file/protocol/code/doc/etc>
```

```text
<<<TOOL>>>
<the analysis tool / standard / checklist>
<<<TARGET>>>
<the target artifact to audit/optimize>
```

Optional per-item previous state:

```text
<<<PREV>>>
<previous PA_PVP machine state for this item>
```

Normal continuation can use snapshot-as-input instead: paste the whole previous PA_PVP output and the kernel recovers prior item state.

## 🎛️ AskUser switch

The kernel contains a contract switch:

```text
AskUser = OFF
```

Default `OFF` means PA_PVP should not ask the operator for missing evidence. It simulates, parks, probes, or cuts by rule.

Set it to:

```text
AskUser = ON
```

when you want the kernel to allow one minimal operator-facing evidence request. Even then, AskUser is gated: the item must be non-terminal, externally blocked, and mechanically eligible.

## 📦 Output contract

For decision runs, PA_PVP emits exactly one machine code block.

The code block starts with:

```text
STATE: DECISION.TEST.FINAL
```

Inside the code block, section order is:

```text
[USER_PANEL]
[PANEL]
[QUEUE]
[ITEM id=...]
```

`[RECOVERY_INPUT]` is optional and appears only when explicitly requested.

After the code block, PA_PVP emits a derived-only `[HUMAN_TABLE]`. The table is not machine state.

If `STATE: DECISION.TEST.FINAL` is missing, the output is non-operational and must not be used for execution.

## 🧾 Queue and lifecycle

`[QUEUE]` is the scan surface for execution:

```text
id | prev_state->new_state | verdict | impact | urgency | ds | term | ct | pp | exp | gate | step1
```

Core verdicts:

- `DO NOW`
- `DO LATER`
- `DISCARD`

Core states:

- `DRAFT`
- `ACTIVE`
- `STANDBY`
- `PROBING`
- `CLOSED`
- `EXPIRED`
- `DISCARDED`

Basic mapping:

- `DO NOW` -> `ACTIVE`
- `DO LATER` -> `STANDBY`
- `DISCARD` -> `DISCARDED`

`CLOSED` is used only when the decision is finalized for now. `PROBING` is used when the decision needs an active reality probe or acquisition step.

## 🪜 Surface scaling

The kernel scales output by state.

Low-impact or DIY items use `MIN_SURFACE` unless they enter probing or hit a gate that requires more structure.

Items expand to DEBUG/full structure when contested or when a real gate is active.

This keeps small decisions light without losing rigor for higher-risk work.

## 🚦 Gates and triggers

PA_PVP derives one `dominant_gate` per item.

Gate vocabulary:

- `FAIL_FAST_CUT`
- `FALSIFICATION`
- `DEBT_CEILING`
- `FRAGILITY`
- `DEPENDENCY_BLOCK`
- `CONFIDENCE_CAP`
- `EXTERNAL_BLOCK`
- `REDESIGN_TRIGGER`
- `SCORE_TRIAGE`
- `NONE`

Triggers map into gates by the kernel's `DOMINANT_GATE_MAP`. The gate is diagnostic and routing-oriented; it should not invent new semantics.

`SCORE_TRIAGE` is reserved for explicit score/impact routing. It must not be used only to expand output scale.

## 🧩 Missing source input

If a step or claim depends on missing source text, missing diff, missing original item body, missing commit hash, missing file target, or missing referenced source block, the kernel marks `required_source_missing=YES`.

It then does exactly one:

- acquire the identifiable missing source with one bounded step
- park the item in `STANDBY`
- discard only if a higher-priority rule already forces discard

It does not reconstruct missing text, diffs, hashes, file targets, or source blocks from prose.

## 🪓 Fail-fast and weak plans

The PLAN fail-fast gate applies when a plan lacks:

- clear goal state
- hard constraint

If `CopyPasteMode=NO_LOOK` or `AskUserMode=NONE`, PA_PVP auto-derives minimal specs as `SIMULATED` and continues.

If `CopyPasteMode=MANUAL` and `AskUserMode=ALLOW`, it may ask for minimal specs and stop that item.

Repeated fail-fast reaches cut mode and discards the item with `FAIL_FAST_CUT`.

## ▶️ Steps and NEXT

Steps are executable or measurable.

Step grammar:

```text
S{n}: <OBSERVABLE_VERB> <OBJECT> -> <OUTPUT> | timebox<=<N>m | fail_if=<OBSERVABLE_CONDITION>
```

`[NEXT]` must match one emitted step. It cannot invent a new action.

If more than five steps are needed, PA_PVP emits the first five executable steps after Step 1 priority and normal ordering, or splits independent sub-goals into separate items.

## 🧪 Evidence and closure

Default run profile:

```text
ExecCapability=NO_RUNTIME
ClosePolicy=SIM_OK
```

This allows simulated closure when real execution is unavailable, but simulated closure must remain labeled.

Closure tiers:

- `ct:SIM` = simulated closure
- `ct:REAL` = closure backed by historical, real, or experimental evidence

Irreversible or `REAL_ONLY` decisions cannot close as simulated. If real evidence is missing, the item parks with `CLOSE_BLOCKED_REAL_ONLY`.

## 🔬 Probes, debt, and hedge actions

Low-confidence critical drivers push the item toward `PROBING` unless a higher-priority rule blocks it.

When an item enters `PROBING`, it includes `[PROBE_LOG]`.

When an item carries Falsification Debt outside DIY mode, `[PROBE_LOG]` appears only if current or previous probe entries exist. The kernel must not fabricate probe entries to explain debt.

Debt is tracked by critical driver, with a ceiling of two active debt drivers.

Hedge actions are allowed only when Cost of Delay is high, waiting exceeds the opportunity window, the action is reversible or risk-contained, a risk cap is declared, a parallel probe starts, and Falsification Debt is declared.

## 📋 Reports

`REPORT LITE` and `REPORT` are read-only render passes over one PA_PVP snapshot.

Reports must not:

- change verdicts
- change gates
- change triggers
- change steps
- introduce new facts
- output a new machine state block

Reports are for reading. They are not reusable state.

## ⛔ Invalid output

If `[PANEL]` contains `OutputValidity: INVALID`, the output is diagnostic only.

Do not use invalid output as `<<<PREV>>>`.

Do not recover snapshot state from invalid output.

## 🛠️ Editing the kernel

The protocol is a behavioral contract, not a prose article.

When changing it:

- keep execution rules inside the kernel
- keep human explanation inside this README
- avoid version metadata and packaging text inside the kernel
- prefer deterministic branches over vague guidance
- keep AskUser gated by the contract switch
- keep missing source handling non-fabricating
- preserve snapshot-as-input and delta-only ping-pong
